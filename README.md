# VGG16-based-Image-Classification
This repository contains code for implementing a VGG16 model with the CBAM (Convolutional Block Attention Module) and visualizing feature maps.

# Overview
The code consists of two main parts:

## VGG16 Model with CBAM

Implementation of a VGG16 model with CBAM integrated.
Pre-trained weights from the ImageNet dataset are used for the VGG16 backbone.
CBAM is added after the last layer of the VGG16 model.
Customizable output layers for classification.
Feature Map Visualization

Load an example image for testing the model.
Perform inference on the loaded image before and after applying CBAM.
Visualize the classification results before and after CBAM.
Extract and visualize feature maps from specific layers of the model.
# Prerequisites
Before running the code, make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

TensorFlow
Keras
Matplotlib
NumPy
# You can install these dependencies using pip:

pip install tensorflow keras matplotlib numpy

# Clone the repository to your local machine:

git clone https://github.com/patllola/VGG16-based-Image-Classification.git
  cd VGG16-based-Image-Classification.git
Download the pre-trained VGG16 weights from the Keras Applications page and save them in the project directory.

Replace the example image in the img_path variable with the path to your own input image.

# Run the code:

python your_script.py
Replace your_script.py with the name of the Python script containing the code.

The code will perform inference on the input image, visualize classification results before and after CBAM, and display feature maps for specified layers.
# Configuration
You can customize the code by adjusting the following:

# input_shape: Modify the input shape as needed.
# Output layers: Customize the output layers according to your classification task.
Specify layers for feature map visualization by modifying the layer_names list.
